player createDiaryRecord ["Diary",["Tips","<marker name='Map'>ACE3 A3Wasteland Lingor</marker>
<br/>
<br/>- At the start of the game, spread out and find supplies before worrying about where to establish a meeting place or a base, supplies are important and very valuable.
<br/>- When picking a base location, it is best advised to pick a place that is out of the way and not so obvious such as airports, cities, map-bound bases, etc. remember, players randomly spawn in and around towns and could even spawn inside your base should you set it up in a town.
<br/>- If you spawn in an area with no vehicles or supplies in the immediate area, DO NOT just click respawn from the pause menu, chances are if you search an area of a few hundred meters, you will find something.
<br/>- Always be on the lookout for nightvision. they are located in the ammo crates, and there are pairs scattered throughout vehicles. You can also purchase them from the gunstores. Nighttime without them SUCKS, and if you have them, you can conduct stealth raids on enemy bases under the cover of complete darkness.
<br/>- When you set up a base, never leave your supplies unguarded, one guard will suffice, but it is recommended you have at least 2, maybe 3 guards at base at all times.
<br/>- There are very aggressive AI characters that spawn with most missions and will protect the mission objectives with deadly force, be aware of them.
<br/>- Grenades have fragmentation.
<br/>
<marker name='Explode'>Explosives Information</marker>
<br/>There is Advanced explosives placement in ACE3 which enables more precise placement of explosives.
<br/>
<br/>There are different trigger types, like clackers and deadman switches.
<br/>
<br/>You can attach explosives to vehicles and buildings (some).
<br/>
<br/>How to use advanced placement:

<br/>    Use self interaction Ctrl+⊞ Win (ACE3 default key bind Self Interaction Key).
<br/>    Select Explosives.
<br/>    Choose your explosive type and follow the instructions on the screen.
<br/>
<br/>Arming and Detonation:

<br/>    Interact with the explosive ⊞ Win (ACE3 default key bind Interact Key).
<br/>    Choose the arming method.
<br/>    For clackers use Self Interaction Explosives → Detonate and choose the corresponding Firing Device.
<br/>
<br/>Defusal:

<br/>    A Defusal Kit is required.
<br/>    Interact with the explosive ⊞ Win.
<br/>    Select Disarm.
<br/>    You are safe to pick it up after the action has completed.

<br/>    The interaction is located around the hands in the form of a handcuffs icon.
<br/>    Repeat to release.
<br/>
<br/>Escorting:

<br/>    Interact with the captive ⊞ win.
<br/>    Select the Escort prisoner option.
<br/>    To stop escorting, use the mousewheel and select Release or use Self Interaction Ctrl+⊞ win and select Release.
<br/>
<br/>Loading and Unloading captives from vehicles:

<marker name='MicroDAGR'>MicroDAGR</marker>
<br/>
<br/>Military operations rely on the position, navigation and timing (PNT) data that GPS can provide. In combat, the accuracy of PNT data can mean the difference between life and death. Non-military GPS receivers simply aren’t good enough when lives are on the line (Extracted from the real life manual)
<br/>
<br/>that's where the MicroDAGR comes in, here's a list of it's features (in Arma 3) :
<br/>
<br/>   - Compass and headings.
<br/>   - Date and hour synced to the mission.
<br/>   - Elevation (above or below sea level)
<br/>   - Current speed.
<br/>   - GPS with topographic and satellite view.
<br/>   - Creating, naming, deleting waypoints.
<br/>   - Friendly identification (BLUFOR tracker need to be on)
<br/>   - The MicroDAGR is also able to connect to your vector to retrieve data from it.
<br/>
<br/>Usage:
<br/>Check the MicroDAGR section.
<br/>
<marker name='MK6Mortar'>MK6 Mortar</marker>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>Usage:
<br/>Switching charge:
<br/>- Press F (Arma 3 default key bind Fire Mode Switch) to switch between charges
<br/>
<br/>Opening the table:
<br/>
<br/>    Self interact Ctrl + ⊞ Win
<br/>    Select Equipment.
<br/>    Select Open 82mm Rangetable.
<br/>
<br/>Getting your shells to land where you want:
<br/>For this you need a 82mm Rangetable, Map Tools and a Vector 21 are also recommended.
<br/>
<br/>    - Get the distance and elevation difference between you and the target (you can use map tools).
<br/>    - Select the charge you want to use (0 = close / 1 = medium / 2 = far).
<br/>    - Open the 82mm Rangetable
<br/>    - Calculate the correct ELEV (elevation):
<br/>       + Open the 82mm Rangetable and click on the charge you are using.
<br/>       + Find your range under the RANGE column
<br/>       + Under the ELEV column find the number that matches your range, that's the base elevation you are going to work with.
<br/>       + Under the D ELEV for 100m DR find the number that matches your ELEV and compensate:
<br/>           * Example, if you're 200m above your target multiply the number by 2 and add it to your ELEV.
<br/>           * If you're 200m below the target multiply the number by 2 and substract it to your ELEV.
<br/>           * The lower the elevation the closer to you it will land.
<br/>       + Once you finished calculating the ELEV align the barrel of the mortar with your target (directly looking at it) and set your ELEV to what you calculated by using Page Up and Page Down.
<br/>       + Once the ELEV is correctly set and the barrel is facing the right direction, shoot and enjoy your bananas while watching hell rain on your enemies.
<br/>

<br/>ACE3 adds a realistic depiction of the Vector 21 rangefinder to the game. Unlike other rangefinders, it doesn't just magically show you the range to your target, but in exchange allows you to do alot of things with it that the other choices in Arma do not offer. The Vector's functions include, but are not limited to:
<br/>
<br/>    Distance to a target
<br/>    Azimuth to a target
<br/>    Horizontal and vertical distance to a target
<br/>    Distance between 2 targets
<br/>    Angle between 2 targets
<br/>    Switching between feet and meters
<br/>    Switching between degrees and mils ...

<br/>
<br/>All wounds must be fully healed before injecting Morphine or Epinephrine. The same applies for Blood Transfusions. Otherwise, the medicine or blood will not take effect.
<br/>
<br/>Morphine = Kill pain
<br/>Epinephrine = Revive
<br/>Blood = Refill blood supply
<br/>
<br/>As you take damage and bleed, your blood supply gets lower and the color bleeds out from the screen. You will also pass out quicker and bleed out faster so when you notice that your blood is low (use Diagnose on head or use the Medical Menu), get a blood transfusion ASAP.
<br/>
<br/>It is possible to OD on Morphine or Epinephrine.
<br/>
<br/>Ear Plugs are provided when you spawn. Put them in to reduce the chance of hearing damage or deafness when firing large caliber weapons or near explosions. Miniguns and such weapons when fired long enough will still cause deafness so fire in bursts.
<br/>
<marker name='MedicalMenu'>Medical Menus</marker>
<br/>
<br/>There are 2 main Medical Menus: The first is the standard method in the rotary wheel. You select Medical and then the body part and then the action. The second is called Medical Menu. If it does not show up when you Self-Interact or Interact with someone else, you can enable it by pressing Escape and clicking the ACE Menu at the top left. Filter for Medical and find the option about Medical Menu and enable it.
<br/>
<br/>The more you get wounded and patched up, the more bandages and medicine is required to heal you. After a certain amount of damage/healing cycles, you will die straight away from your body not being able to handle it.
<br/>
<marker name='Revive'>Revive System</marker>
<br/>How the Revive System works:
<br/>The revive system lets you bring downed units back up. Upon receiving a deadly amount of damage a unit will fall unconscious for a determined amount of time. In that time a medic will need to treat them and give them epinephrine to bring them back up.
<br/>
<marker name='MedicalUsage'>Medical Guide</marker>
<br/>Basic Medical usage:
<br/>When hit, units start to lose blood depending on the severity of their wounds. Once the level of blood falls below a certain threshold, the unit will fall unconscious and eventually die. Units will also fall unconscious when sustaining large amounts of damage at once or from high amounts of pain.
<br/>
<br/>Guide to wounds:
<br/>It's pretty straightforward compared to advanced, you only have two types of wounds.
<br/>
<br/>--> Yellow: you need one bandage to heal it.
<br/>-->  Red: you need two bandages to heal it.
<br/>
<marker name='Triage'>TRIAGE</marker>
<br/>TRIAGE Guide for ACE3 Wasteland:
<br/>Step 1: Is the patient responsive?
<br/>
<br/>    Yes: Ask him if he has wounds / he is in pain.
<br/>    No: Go to step 2.
<br/>
<br/>Step 2: Is the patient wounded?
<br/>
<br/>    Yes: Treat the wounds and go to step 3.
<br/>    No: Skip this step.
<br/>
<br/>Step 3: Is the patient in pain?
<br/>
<br/>    Yes: Give him morphine.
<br/>    No: Skip this step.
<br/>
<br/>Step 4: Did the patient lose a lot of blood?
<br/>
<br/>    Yes: Give blood via IV.
<br/>    No: Go to step 5.
<br/>    No and patient responsive: You're done.
<br/>
<br/>Step 5
<br/>
<br/>    If at this point the patient is still not back on its feet it's time to use an epinephrine Autoinjector.
<br/>
<br/>
<marker name='AddInfo'>Additional information:</marker>
<br/>
<br/>Even if a tank shoots your ass off an epinephrine shot will bring you back up after your wounds are treated. (The timer is invisible and may vary from mission to mission, it also depends on the amount of lives remaining you have.)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>  -  A unit in the revive state will be unconscious and will stay unconscious until it is either woken up or the revive timer runs out.
<br/>  -  A unit in the revive state can't die from any source of damage, only the timer ending can kill it.
<br/>  -  Each successful CPR (full bar) will increase the time the unit can stay in the revive state before dying.
<br/>  -  To wake up a patient treat all of his wounds, make sure he isn't in pain and then use epinephrine.
<br/>  -  Each successful revive removes a life from the unit, once the lives run out the next time the unit will take fatal damage it will not enter the revive state and will die.

  player createDiaryRecord ["Diary",["Tips","<marker name='Map'>ACE3 A3Wasteland Lingor</marker>
  <br/>
  <br/>- At the start of the game, spread out and find supplies before worrying about where to establish a meeting place or a base, supplies are important and very valuable.
  <br/>- When picking a base location, it is best advised to pick a place that is out of the way and not so obvious such as airports, cities, map-bound bases, etc. remember, players randomly spawn in and around towns and could even spawn inside your base should you set it up in a town.
  <br/>- If you spawn in an area with no vehicles or supplies in the immediate area, DO NOT just click respawn from the pause menu, chances are if you search an area of a few hundred meters, you will find something.
  <br/>- Always be on the lookout for nightvision. they are located in the ammo crates, and there are pairs scattered throughout vehicles. You can also purchase them from the gunstores. Nighttime without them SUCKS, and if you have them, you can conduct stealth raids on enemy bases under the cover of complete darkness.
  <br/>- When you set up a base, never leave your supplies unguarded, one guard will suffice, but it is recommended you have at least 2, maybe 3 guards at base at all times.
  <br/>- There are very aggressive AI characters that spawn with most missions and will protect the mission objectives with deadly force, be aware of them.
  <br/>- Grenades have fragmentation.
  <br/>
  <marker name='Explode'>Explosives Information</marker>
  <br/>There is Advanced explosives placement in ACE3 which enables more precise placement of explosives.
  <br/>
  <br/>There are different trigger types, like clackers and deadman switches.
  <br/>
  <br/>You can attach explosives to vehicles and buildings (some).
  <br/>
  <br/>How to use advanced placement:

  <br/>    Use self interaction Ctrl+⊞ Win (ACE3 default key bind Self Interaction Key).
  <br/>    Select Explosives.
  <br/>    Choose your explosive type and follow the instructions on the screen.
  <br/>
  <br/>Arming and Detonation:

  <br/>    Interact with the explosive ⊞ Win (ACE3 default key bind Interact Key).
  <br/>    Choose the arming method.
  <br/>    For clackers use Self Interaction Explosives → Detonate and choose the corresponding Firing Device.
  <br/>
  <br/>Defusal:

  <br/>    A Defusal Kit is required.
  <br/>    Interact with the explosive ⊞ Win.
  <br/>    Select Disarm.
  <br/>    You are safe to pick it up after the action has completed.
  <br/>
  <marker name='Captives'>So you want to take someone hostage:</marker>

  <br/>- You can load and unload captives from vehicles using ACE3 interactions.
  <br/>- You can frisk a restrained captive.
  <br/>- Allows players to surrender. It renders the unit unable to move and with the hands behind its head. When surrendered AI won't fire.
  <br/>
  <br/>Usage:

  <br/>    You need Cable Tie.
  <br/>    Approach the unit and Interact ⊞ win (ACE3 default).
  <br/>    The interaction is located around the hands in the form of a handcuffs icon.
  <br/>    Repeat to release.
  <br/>
  <br/>Escorting:

  <br/>    Interact with the captive ⊞ win.
  <br/>    Select the Escort prisoner option.
  <br/>    To stop escorting, use the mousewheel and select Release or use Self Interaction Ctrl+⊞ win and select Release.
  <br/>
  <br/>Loading and Unloading captives from vehicles:

  <br/>    Escort the captive.
  <br/>    Approach the vehicle you wish to load the captive unit into.
  <br/>    Interact with the vehicle ⊞ win and select Load captive.
  <br/>    To unload the captive interact with the vehicle ⊞ win

  <marker name='MicroDAGR'>MicroDAGR</marker>
  <br/>
  <br/>Military operations rely on the position, navigation and timing (PNT) data that GPS can provide. In combat, the accuracy of PNT data can mean the difference between life and death. Non-military GPS receivers simply aren’t good enough when lives are on the line (Extracted from the real life manual)
  <br/>
  <br/>that's where the MicroDAGR comes in, here's a list of it's features (in Arma 3) :
  <br/>
  <br/>   - Compass and headings.
  <br/>   - Date and hour synced to the mission.
  <br/>   - Elevation (above or below sea level)
  <br/>   - Current speed.
  <br/>   - GPS with topographic and satellite view.
  <br/>   - Creating, naming, deleting waypoints.
  <br/>   - Friendly identification (BLUFOR tracker need to be on)
  <br/>   - The MicroDAGR is also able to connect to your vector to retrieve data from it.
  <br/>
  <br/>Usage:
  <br/>Check the MicroDAGR section.
  <br/>
  <marker name='MK6Mortar'>MK6 Mortar</marker>
  <br/>
  <br/>ACE3 adds wind deflection for shells as well as a rangetable to accurately take out your target without the artillery computer.
  <br/>
  <br/>Usage:
  <br/>Switching charge:
  <br/>- Press F (Arma 3 default key bind Fire Mode Switch) to switch between charges
  <br/>
  <br/>Opening the table:
  <br/>
  <br/>    Self interact Ctrl + ⊞ Win
  <br/>    Select Equipment.
  <br/>    Select Open 82mm Rangetable.
  <br/>
  <br/>Getting your shells to land where you want:
  <br/>For this you need a 82mm Rangetable, Map Tools and a Vector 21 are also recommended.
  <br/>
  <br/>    - Get the distance and elevation difference between you and the target (you can use map tools).
  <br/>    - Select the charge you want to use (0 = close / 1 = medium / 2 = far).
  <br/>    - Open the 82mm Rangetable
  <br/>    - Calculate the correct ELEV (elevation):
  <br/>       + Open the 82mm Rangetable and click on the charge you are using.
  <br/>       + Find your range under the RANGE column
  <br/>       + Under the ELEV column find the number that matches your range, that's the base elevation you are going to work with.
  <br/>       + Under the D ELEV for 100m DR find the number that matches your ELEV and compensate:
  <br/>           * Example, if you're 200m above your target multiply the number by 2 and add it to your ELEV.
  <br/>           * If you're 200m below the target multiply the number by 2 and substract it to your ELEV.
  <br/>           * The lower the elevation the closer to you it will land.
  <br/>       + Once you finished calculating the ELEV align the barrel of the mortar with your target (directly looking at it) and set your ELEV to what you calculated by using Page Up and Page Down.
  <br/>       + Once the ELEV is correctly set and the barrel is facing the right direction, shoot and enjoy your bananas while watching hell rain on your enemies.
  <br/>
  <marker name='Rangecard'>Rangecard</marker>
  <br/>
  <br/>Add a range card that updates itself for your weapon and the type of ammo you're using.
  <br/>
  <br/>Usage:
  <br/>
  <br/>    Open the self interaction menu Ctrl + ⊞ Win
  <br/>    Select Equipment
  <br/>    Select Open Range Card
  <br/>
  <br/>Using the range card effectively:
  <br/>
  <br/>   - To use this to it's full potential the use of a Vector 21 is strongly recommended, a Kestrel 4500 will also help.
  <br/>   - Pull out your rangefinder (Vector 21 preferred) and get the distance between you and your target.
  <br/>   - Open your rangetable and look under the Target range column.
  <br/>   - Move to the Bullet Drop column, the drop is in MRADs, you need to compensate for it by adjusting your sight. Example, you want to adjust for a bullet drop of -7.9 MRADs simply adjust your scope 7.9 MRADs vertically.
  <br/>
  <marker name='Sandbags'>Sandbags</marker>
  <br/>Adds stackable sandbags able to block bullets, shrapnel and small explosions. Note that those sandbags are affected by physics, a rocket will send them flying.

  <br/>
  <br/>ACE3 adds a realistic depiction of the Vector 21 rangefinder to the game. Unlike other rangefinders, it doesn't just magically show you the range to your target, but in exchange allows you to do alot of things with it that the other choices in Arma do not offer. The Vector's functions include, but are not limited to:
  <br/>
  <br/>    Distance to a target
  <br/>    Azimuth to a target
  <br/>    Horizontal and vertical distance to a target

  <br/>All wounds must be fully healed before injecting Morphine or Epinephrine. The same applies for Blood Transfusions. Otherwise, the medicine or blood will not take effect.
  <br/>
  <br/>Morphine = Kill pain
  <br/>Epinephrine = Revive
  <br/>Blood = Refill blood supply
  <br/>
  <br/>As you take damage and bleed, your blood supply gets lower and the color bleeds out from the screen. You will also pass out quicker and bleed out faster so when you notice that your blood is low (use Diagnose on head or use the Medical Menu), get a blood transfusion ASAP.
  <br/>
  <br/>It is possible to OD on Morphine or Epinephrine.
  <br/>
  <br/>Ear Plugs are provided when you spawn. Put them in to reduce the chance of hearing damage or deafness when firing large caliber weapons or near explosions. Miniguns and such weapons when fired long enough will still cause deafness so fire in bursts.
  <br/>
  <marker name='MedicalMenu'>Medical Menus</marker>
  <br/>
  <br/>There are 2 main Medical Menus: The first is the standard method in the rotary wheel. You select Medical and then the body part and then the action. The second is called Medical Menu. If it does not show up when you Self-Interact or Interact with someone else, you can enable it by pressing Escape and clicking the ACE Menu at the top left. Filter for Medical and find the option about Medical Menu and enable it.
  <br/>
  <br/>The more you get wounded and patched up, the more bandages and medicine is required to heal you. After a certain amount of damage/healing cycles, you will die straight away from your body not being able to handle it.
  <br/>
  <marker name='Revive'>Revive System</marker>
  <br/>How the Revive System works:
  <br/>The revive system lets you bring downed units back up. Upon receiving a deadly amount of damage a unit will fall unconscious for a determined amount of time. In that time a medic will need to treat them and give them epinephrine to bring them back up.
  <br/>
  <marker name='MedicalUsage'>Medical Guide</marker>
  <br/>Basic Medical usage:
  <br/>When hit, units start to lose blood depending on the severity of their wounds. Once the level of blood falls below a certain threshold, the unit will fall unconscious and eventually die. Units will also fall unconscious when sustaining large amounts of damage at once or from high amounts of pain.
  <br/>
  <br/>Guide to wounds:
  <br/>It's pretty straightforward compared to advanced, you only have two types of wounds.
  <br/>
  <br/>--> Yellow: you need one bandage to heal it.
  <br/>-->  Red: you need two bandages to heal it.
  <br/>
  <marker name='Triage'>TRIAGE</marker>
  <br/>TRIAGE Guide for ACE3 Wasteland:
  <br/>Step 1: Is the patient responsive?
  <br/>
  <br/>    Yes: Ask him if he has wounds / he is in pain.
  <br/>    No: Go to step 2.
  <br/>
  <br/>Step 2: Is the patient wounded?
  <br/>
  <br/>    Yes: Treat the wounds and go to step 3.
  <br/>    No: Skip this step.
  <br/>
  <br/>Step 3: Is the patient in pain?
  <br/>
  <br/>    Yes: Give him morphine.
  <br/>    No: Skip this step.
  <br/>
  <br/>Step 4: Did the patient lose a lot of blood?
  <br/>
  <br/>    Yes: Give blood via IV.
  <br/>    No: Go to step 5.
  <br/>    No and patient responsive: You're done.
  <br/>
  <br/>Step 5
  <br/>
  <br/>    If at this point the patient is still not back on its feet it's time to use an epinephrine Autoinjector.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <marker name='AddInfo'>Additional information:</marker>
  <br/>
  <br/>Even if a tank shoots your ass off an epinephrine shot will bring you back up after your wounds are treated. (The timer is invisible and may vary from mission to mission, it also depends on the amount of lives remaining you have.)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>  -  A unit in the revive state will be unconscious and will stay unconscious until it is either woken up or the revive timer runs out.
  <br/>  -  A unit in the revive state can't die from any source of damage, only the timer ending can kill it.
  <br/>  -  Each successful CPR (full bar) will increase the time the unit can stay in the revive state before dying.
  <br/>  -  To wake up a patient treat all of his wounds, make sure he isn't in pain and then use epinephrine.
  <br/>  -  Each successful revive removes a life from the unit, once the lives run out the next time the unit will take fatal damage it will not enter the revive state and will die.

  player createDiaryRecord ["Diary",["Tips","<marker name='Map'>ACE3 A3Wasteland Lingor</marker>
  <br/>
  <br/>- At the start of the game, spread out and find supplies before worrying about where to establish a meeting place or a base, supplies are important and very valuable.
  <br/>- When picking a base location, it is best advised to pick a place that is out of the way and not so obvious such as airports, cities, map-bound bases, etc. remember, players randomly spawn in and around towns and could even spawn inside your base should you set it up in a town.
  <br/>- If you spawn in an area with no vehicles or supplies in the immediate area, DO NOT just click respawn from the pause menu, chances are if you search an area of a few hundred meters, you will find something.
  <br/>- Always be on the lookout for nightvision. they are located in the ammo crates, and there are pairs scattered throughout vehicles. You can also purchase them from the gunstores. Nighttime without them SUCKS, and if you have them, you can conduct stealth raids on enemy bases under the cover of complete darkness.
  <br/>- When you set up a base, never leave your supplies unguarded, one guard will suffice, but it is recommended you have at least 2, maybe 3 guards at base at all times.
  <br/>- There are very aggressive AI characters that spawn with most missions and will protect the mission objectives with deadly force, be aware of them.
  <br/>- Grenades have fragmentation.
  <br/>
  <marker name='Explode'>Explosives Information</marker>
  <br/>There is Advanced explosives placement in ACE3 which enables more precise placement of explosives.
  <br/>
  <br/>There are different trigger types, like clackers and deadman switches.
  <br/>
  <br/>You can attach explosives to vehicles and buildings (some).
  <br/>
  <br/>How to use advanced placement:

  <br/>    Use self interaction Ctrl+⊞ Win (ACE3 default key bind Self Interaction Key).
  <br/>    Select Explosives.
  <br/>    Choose your explosive type and follow the instructions on the screen.
  <br/>
  <br/>Arming and Detonation:

  <br/>    Interact with the explosive ⊞ Win (ACE3 default key bind Interact Key).
  <br/>    Choose the arming method.
  <br/>    For clackers use Self Interaction Explosives → Detonate and choose the corresponding Firing Device.
  <br/>
  <br/>Defusal:

  <br/>    A Defusal Kit is required.
  <br/>    Interact with the explosive ⊞ Win.
  <br/>    Select Disarm.
  <br/>    You are safe to pick it up after the action has completed.
  <br/>
  <marker name='Captives'>So you want to take someone hostage:</marker>

  <br/>- You can load and unload captives from vehicles using ACE3 interactions.
  <br/>- You can frisk a restrained captive.
  <br/>- Allows players to surrender. It renders the unit unable to move and with the hands behind its head. When surrendered AI won't fire.
  <br/>
  <br/>Usage:

  <marker name='MicroDAGR'>MicroDAGR</marker>
  <br/>
  <br/>Military operations rely on the position, navigation and timing (PNT) data that GPS can provide. In combat, the accuracy of PNT data can mean the difference between life and death. Non-military GPS receivers simply aren’t good enough when lives are on the line (Extracted from the real life manual)
  <br/>

  <br/>
  <br/>Opening the table:
  <br/>
  <br/>    Self interact Ctrl + ⊞ Win
  <br/>    Select Equipment.
  <br/>    Select Open 82mm Rangetable.
  <br/>
  <br/>Getting your shells to land where you want:
  <br/>For this you need a 82mm Rangetable, Map Tools and a Vector 21 are also recommended.
  <br/>
  <br/>    - Get the distance and elevation difference between you and the target (you can use map tools).
  <br/>    - Select the charge you want to use (0 = close / 1 = medium / 2 = far).
  <br/>    - Open the 82mm Rangetable
  <br/>    - Calculate the correct ELEV (elevation):
  <br/>       + Open the 82mm Rangetable and click on the charge you are using.
  <br/>       + Find your range under the RANGE column
  <br/>       + Under the ELEV column find the number that matches your range, that's the base elevation you are going to work with.
  <br/>       + Under the D ELEV for 100m DR find the number that matches your ELEV and compensate:
  <br/>           * Example, if you're 200m above your target multiply the number by 2 and add it to your ELEV.
  <br/>           * If you're 200m below the target multiply the number by 2 and substract it to your ELEV.
  <br/>           * The lower the elevation the closer to you it will land.
  <br/>       + Once you finished calculating the ELEV align the barrel of the mortar with your target (directly looking at it) and set your ELEV to what you calculated by using Page Up and Page Down.
  <br/>       + Once the ELEV is correctly set and the barrel is facing the right direction, shoot and enjoy your bananas while watching hell rain on your enemies.

  <br/>All wounds must be fully healed before injecting Morphine or Epinephrine. The same applies for Blood Transfusions. Otherwise, the medicine or blood will not take effect.
  <br/>
  <br/>Morphine = Kill pain
  <br/>Epinephrine = Revive
  <br/>Blood = Refill blood supply
  <br/>
  <br/>As you take damage and bleed, your blood supply gets lower and the color bleeds out from the screen. You will also pass out quicker and bleed out faster so when you notice that your blood is low (use Diagnose on head or use the Medical Menu), get a blood transfusion ASAP.

  <br/>The more you get wounded and patched up, the more bandages and medicine is required to heal you. After a certain amount of damage/healing cycles, you will die straight away from your body not being able to handle it.
  <br/>
  <marker name='Revive'>Revive System</marker>
  <br/>How the Revive System works:
  <br/>The revive system lets you bring downed units back up. Upon receiving a deadly amount of damage a unit will fall unconscious for a determined amount of time. In that time a medic will need to treat them and give them epinephrine to bring them back up.
  <br/>
  <marker name='MedicalUsage'>Medical Guide</marker>
  <br/>Basic Medical usage:
  <br/>When hit, units start to lose blood depending on the severity of their wounds. Once the level of blood falls below a certain threshold, the unit will fall unconscious and eventually die. Units will also fall unconscious when sustaining large amounts of damage at once or from high amounts of pain.
  <br/>
  <br/>Guide to wounds:
  <br/>It's pretty straightforward compared to advanced, you only have two types of wounds.
  <br/>
  <br/>--> Yellow: you need one bandage to heal it.
  <br/>-->  Red: you need two bandages to heal it.

  <br/>
  <br/>    Yes: Ask him if he has wounds / he is in pain.
  <br/>    No: Go to step 2.
  <br/>
  <br/>Step 2: Is the patient wounded?
  <br/>
  <br/>    Yes: Treat the wounds and go to step 3.
  <br/>    No: Skip this step.
  <br/>
  <br/>Step 3: Is the patient in pain?
  <br/>
  <br/>    Yes: Give him morphine.
  <br/>    No: Skip this step.
  <br/>
  <br/>Step 4: Did the patient lose a lot of blood?
  <br/>
  <br/>    Yes: Give blood via IV.

  <br/>    No and patient responsive: You're done.
  <br/>
  <br/>Step 5
  <br/>
  <br/>    If at this point the patient is still not back on its feet it's time to use an epinephrine Autoinjector.

  <br/>
  <marker name='AddInfo'>Additional information:</marker>
  <br/>
  <br/>Even if a tank shoots your ass off an epinephrine shot will bring you back up after your wounds are treated. (The timer is invisible and may vary from mission to mission, it also depends on the amount of lives remaining you have.)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>  -  A unit in the revive state will be unconscious and will stay unconscious until it is either woken up or the revive timer runs out.
  <br/>  -  A unit in the revive state can't die from any source of damage, only the timer ending can kill it.
  <br/>  -  Each successful CPR (full bar) will increase the time the unit can stay in the revive state before dying.
  <br/>  -  To wake up a patient treat all of his wounds, make sure he isn't in pain and then use epinephrine.
  <br/>  -  Each successful revive removes a life from the unit, once the lives run out the next time the unit will take fatal damage it will not enter the revive state and will die.
